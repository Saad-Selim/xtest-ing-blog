      "element": "login button"
    },
    {
      "action": "input",
      "element": "username field",
      "value": "testuser"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Automating Test Execution

Automating the test execution can save time and effort while ensuring accuracy. Xtest offers an intuitive interface to automate your test executions, ensuring that all aspects of your application are tested thoroughly.
