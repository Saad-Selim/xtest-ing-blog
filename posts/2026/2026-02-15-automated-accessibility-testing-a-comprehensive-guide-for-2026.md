# Automated Accessibility Testing: An Essential Path to Inclusive Software

In today's digital age, having an accessible website is not just about ticking off compliance boxes, but it's about ensuring that your digital space is inclusive and accessible to all. This is where automated accessibility testing comes into play. In this blog post, we'll delve into what automated accessibility testing is, why it's vital, and how it works on our software testing platform, Xtest. We'll also share some practical examples and statistics that emphasize the importance of this aspect of testing. So, let's dive in!

## What is Automated Accessibility Testing?

Automated accessibility testing is a method that employs tools and technologies to check if a website or application is accessible to people with disabilities. It's about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can use and interact with your software. These tools are designed to identify accessibility issues that could potentially prevent some users from fully utilizing your software, such as missing alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, or improper use of HTML elements.

## Why is Automated Accessibility Testing Important?

According to the World Health Organization, over a billion people, or about 15% of the world's population, have some form of disability. This statistic alone underscores the importance of making your software accessible to all users. Not only does accessibility testing help you reach a wider audience, but it also helps you comply with legal Standards like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Automated Accessibility Testing with Xtest

### How does it work?

Our platform, Xtest, provides an intuitive and powerful way to conduct automated accessibility testing. By integrating with your development environment, Xtest can identify accessibility issues early in the development process, making them easier and less costly to fix.

```

// Example of automated accessibility testing using Xtest
const Xtest = require('xtest');

Xtest.runAccessibilityTest({
  url: 'https://yourwebsite.com',
  standards: ['WCAG2AA'],
  report: 'accessibility-report.json'
});
```

This simple code snippet runs an accessibility test on your website against the WCAG 2.0 AA standards and generates a report in JSON format detailing any accessibility issues found.

### Real-World Applications and Benefits

Automated accessibility testing can bring immense benefits to your software development process. For instance, a leading e-commerce company used Xtest's automated accessibility testing to ensure their website was accessible to all users, increasing their potential customer base and improving their reputation for inclusivity.

## Key Aspects of Automated Accessibility Testing

It's important to note that automated accessibility testing cannot cover all accessibility issues. Some aspects, like checking if the website is easy to navigate with a keyboard, still require manual testing. However, automated testing is an excellent first step and can identify most of the potential issues.

## Industry Statistics and Trends

Interest in automated accessibility testing is growing. According to a report from Markets and Markets, the global accessibility testing market is projected to grow from $787 million in 2020 to $2.3 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 24.2% during the forecast period.

## Actionable Takeaways

Automated accessibility testing is a crucial part of the software development process. If you haven't incorporated it into your testing strategy yet, the time to start is now. With Xtest, you can easily integrate automated accessibility testing into your process, ensuring your software is accessible to all and compliant with legal standards.

Start by running simple tests, like the example provided above, and gradually expand your testing to cover more complex accessibility issues. Remember, accessibility isn't just about compliance; it's about inclusivity and reaching out to all potential users.
