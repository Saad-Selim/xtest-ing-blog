# Mock vs Stub vs Spy: When to Use What in Software Testing

In the world of software testing, there are many tools and techniques to ensure your application runs seamlessly and error-free. Three commonly used testing tools are mocks, stubs, and spies. But when should you use each, and what are the differences between them? That's what we'll explore in this blog post on Xtest, your go-to platform for software testing.

## Understanding Mocks, Stubs, and Spies

Before we dive into when to use what, let's take a moment to understand what mocks, stubs, and spies are. These three tools form the backbone of what is called test doubles, a term coined by Gerard Meszaros to describe objects that mimic real objects for testing.

### What is a Mock?

A mock is an imitation of a real object, used to simulate specific behaviors and test specific interactions within the system. Mocks are typically used when the real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into the unit test.

```

// Example of a mock in JavaScript
const mockFunction = jest.fn();
mockFunction();
expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

### What is a Stub?

A stub is a controllable replacement for an existing dependency (or collaborator) in the system. Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside the test method. They are typically used to test the interaction between the object under test and its stub.

```

// Example of a stub in JavaScript
const stub = sinon.stub();
stub.withArgs(42).returns(1);
stub.withArgs(1).throws('TypeError');
```

### What is a Spy?

A spy, on the other hand, is an object that records its interaction with other objects throughout the code base. Spies are most commonly used to gather information during testing, such as ensuring a function is called, what arguments were used, and how many times it was called.

```

// Example of a spy in JavaScript
let spy = sinon.spy(object, "method");
object.method(42);
assert(spy.calledWith(42));
```

## When to Use Mocks, Stubs, or Spies

Now that we understand what mocks, stubs, and spies are, let's discuss when to use each of these testing tools.

### When to Use Mocks

Mocks come in handy when you want to isolate the unit of code being tested. They allow you to 'mock' the behavior of complex dependencies, such as database calls or third-party services, and focus on testing your code's functionality. Use mocks when you want to reproduce specific scenarios that are difficult to test otherwise.

### When to Use Stubs

Stubs are useful when you want to simulate the behavior of code that isn't part of the test. For instance, you can use a stub to mimic the behavior of a database query and return predefined results. This way, you can test how your code handles these results without actually querying the database.

### When to Use Spies

Use spies when you need to verify that a certain function was called or a certain event occurred but do not want to affect the behavior of the object. Spies are also useful for tracking calls over time, making them ideal for testing callbacks and promises.

## Real-World Applications and Benefits

In the real world, mocks, stubs, and spies play a crucial role in maintaining the health of large codebases. According to a 2020 survey by the State of JS, over 75% of developers use these tools in their testing suite.

These tools offer several benefits, including faster test execution as you can bypass time-consuming tasks such as network calls, improved test reliability as you can control every aspect of the test environment, and easier debugging due to the isolation of each unit of code.

## Actionable Takeaways

Understanding how and when to use mocks, stubs, and spies can greatly enhance your testing strategy. Here are some actionable takeaways:

*   Use mocks to isolate the code being tested and reproduce specific scenarios.
*   Use stubs to simulate the behavior of unrelated code and test your code's reactions.
*   Use spies to track function calls and events without affecting the system's behavior.

Incorporate these techniques into your testing suite, and watch your code quality skyrocket!

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure your application's reliability and functionality. So, choose the testing tool that best suits your needs and helps you achieve this goal.

## Conclusion

Whether it's mocks, stubs, or spies, each testing tool has its own unique use cases and benefits. By understanding when to use what, you can enhance your software testing strategy and ensure the delivery of high-quality, reliable software. Happy testing with Xtest!
