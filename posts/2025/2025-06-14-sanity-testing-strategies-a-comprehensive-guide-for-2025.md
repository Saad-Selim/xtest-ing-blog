# Mastering Sanity Testing Strategies with Xtest

As software testers, we often find ourselves in a race against time. The development cycle is ever-accelerating, leaving less room for comprehensive testing. Thankfully, sanity testing provides a quick, efficient way to ensure that a new software version or feature is sound and ready for further testing. This blog post will guide you through effective sanity testing strategies and how to implement them using Xtest, our top-tier software testing platform.

## What is Sanity Testing?

Sanity testing is a surface-level testing strategy that verifies whether the primary functionalities of a system are working as expected. Unlike exhaustive testing methods like regression testing, sanity testing is narrow and unscripted. It is often done after a bug has been fixed or a new feature has been introduced to ensure that the software is sane enough to proceed for more rigorous testing or deployment.

## Why is Sanity Testing Important?

Sanity testing is crucial for several reasons. It saves time by identifying critical issues early in the cycle, it helps avoid unnecessary in-depth testing for unstable applications, and it aids in quick decision making for software releases. According to a [report by Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/software-testing-services-market), the global software testing market size was valued at $45.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% from 2020 to 2027. This underscores the need for efficient testing strategies like sanity testing.

## Top Sanity Testing Strategies

### 1\. Determining Scope

Due to its narrow focus, defining the scope is pivotal in sanity testing. The testing team should decide which functionalities are critical and need sanity testing after every build.

### 2\. Prioritizing Tests

Not all tests are created equal. Some are more crucial than others. Prioritize tests based on the feature's importance, user interaction, and business impact.

### 3\. Automating Sanity Tests

Automation plays a significant role in sanity testing as it can be performed repeatedly. With Xtest, you can easily automate your sanity tests, saving time and ensuring more accurate results.

### 4\. Documenting Results

Documentation is vital for future reference and for identifying recurring issues. Xtest provides a comprehensive report of your sanity tests, which can be easily exported and shared with your team.

## Implementing Sanity Testing with Xtest

Xtest is a powerful tool for implementing and automating your sanity tests. Below are some practical examples of how you can leverage Xtest for sanity testing.

### 1\. Test Case Creation

Creating test cases in Xtest is a simple and straightforward process. Here's how you can create a test case for user login functionality using Xtest:

```

Create a new Test Case
Enter Test Case Name: "User Login Sanity Test"
Enter Precondition: "User is registered and on the login page"
Enter Test Steps:
1. Enter valid Username and Password 
2. Click on 'Login' button
Enter Expected Result: "User should be successfully logged in and redirected to the home page"
```

### 2\. Automating Sanity Tests

Automation is a breeze with Xtest. Once you've created your test cases, you can automate them with a few clicks. Here's how:

```

Select the test case "User Login Sanity Test"
Click on 'Automate Test Case'
Choose the appropriate automation settings
Click on 'Run Automation'
```

## Conclusion

Sanity testing is a critical part of any testing strategy. It helps identify major issues early in the development cycle, saving time and resources. With the right strategies and tools like Xtest, you can master sanity testing and ensure your software's quality and reliability.
