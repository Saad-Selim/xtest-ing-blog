      action: 'validateConsentManagement',
      expectedOutcome: 'compliant'
    },
    // Check data encryption
    {
      action: 'checkDataEncryption',
      expectedOutcome: 'compliant'
    },
    // Check access controls
    {
      action: 'checkAccessControls',
      expectedOutcome: 'compliant'
    }
