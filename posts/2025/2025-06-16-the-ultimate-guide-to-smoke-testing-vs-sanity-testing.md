# Smoke Testing vs Sanity Testing: Unraveling the Differences

Ensuring the quality of software is a paramount concern for any development team. Two crucial testing practices that help achieve this goal are smoke testing and sanity testing. But what exactly are these testing methods, and how do they differ from each other? Let's dive in and unravel the differences.

## Understanding Smoke Testing

Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing, is a high-level type of software testing. The primary goal is to verify the basic functionality of the software to ensure it's ready for further testing.

### When is Smoke Testing Used?

Smoke testing is typically used in the initial development phase. After the first build of a software product is complete, it undergoes smoke testing to ensure that the most critical functions are working as expected. This type of test is designed to catch major issues early in the development process.

### Example of Smoke Testing

```

// Assume we have a basic login functionality
public void testLogin() {
    // Test the happy path
    boolean loginSuccessful = login("username", "password");
    assertTrue(loginSuccessful);
}
```

In the above example, we just ensure that the login function works. If it doesn't, there's no point in proceeding with other tests like password recovery or profile management.

## Understanding Sanity Testing

Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing. It's a quick, focused testing effort that checks for specific functionalities and ensures that bugs or issues have been fixed since the previous build.

### When is Sanity Testing Used?

Sanity testing is typically used after a new build or version of the software is released. It's used to confirm that the changes or fixes made to the software haven't affected other existing functionalities.

### Example of Sanity Testing

```

// Assume a bug was fixed in the login functionality
public void testLoginAfterBugFix() {
    // Test the bug fix
    boolean loginSuccessful = login("username", "password");
    assertTrue(loginSuccessful);

    // Test other related functionalities
    assertTrue(passwordRecovery("username"));
    assertTrue(profileManagement("username"));
}
```

In the above example, we not only test the login functionality after a bug fix but also check to ensure the related functionalities are still working as expected.

## Smoke Testing vs Sanity Testing: The Key Differences

While both smoke testing and sanity testing play pivotal roles in the software testing lifecycle, they serve different purposes and are carried out at different stages of the development process.

*   **Objective:** Smoke testing aims to check if the basic functionalities of the software work correctly. In contrast, sanity testing ensures that the changes or fixes in the software haven't affected the other functionalities.
*   **Scope:** Smoke testing has a broader scope and tests the entire software system, whereas sanity testing has a narrower focus and only tests specific functionalities.
*   **Time:** Smoke testing is usually time-consuming because it covers a larger scope. On the other hand, sanity testing is quicker because it only checks specific functions.

## Real-world Applications and Benefits

Companies like Google and Microsoft employ smoke and sanity testing in their software development process. According to the World Quality Report 2020-21, 99% of organizations use some form of software testing.

Both smoke and sanity testing allow teams to catch and fix bugs early in the development process, reducing the overall cost and time-to-market. These testing methods also contribute to higher customer satisfaction by ensuring the release of high-quality software.

## Actionable Takeaways

Understanding the differences between smoke testing and sanity testing can help you apply the right testing method at the right time. Here's what you should remember:

*   Use smoke testing after the initial build of the software to verify the basic functionalities.
*   Use sanity testing after a new build or version is released to ensure the changes haven't affected the existing functionalities.
*   Remember that while smoke testing has a broader scope, sanity testing is narrower and more focused.

By incorporating these testing methods into your software testing strategy, you can enhance the quality of your software and meet your users' expectations.

## Conclusion

Smoke testing and sanity testing are vital components of any effective software testing strategy. By understanding their differences and applications, teams can ensure a smoother software development process and deliver high-quality products.
